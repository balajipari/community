You're asking whether to build your Ideation-to-Pitch assistant using:

* A **prompt-based chat** system (static prompts guiding responses),
* A **RAG-enhanced chat**, or
* A more sophisticated **Agentic RAG / agentic AI** setup.

Here’s how I’d approach it—stage by stage—with reasoning informed by recent findings:

---

## What’s RAG vs Agentic RAG?

* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines LLMs with external knowledge retrieval—vital for up-to-date, accurate responses grounded in real sources.([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1], [Wikipedia][2])
* **Agentic RAG**: Embeds autonomous decision-making agents that dynamically choose retrieval tools, plan multi-step workflows, and adapt to evolving context. Better for complex, multi-step reasoning.([Medium][3], [arXiv][4])

## Stage-Wise Recommendation

### 1. **Ideation**

* **Best Fit: Prompt-Guided Chat**

  * Why: Simple, structured tasks—collect motto, problem, personas—work well via a valid JSON prompt system.
  * Lightweight and efficient—no need for external knowledge or retrieval mechanisms.

### 2. **Validation (User Interviews, TAM/SAM/SOM)**

* **Next Step: RAG-Based Augmentation**

  * Why: You’ll need up-to-date market stats, benchmarks, competitor data. RAG helps ground guidance in factual, external information.([k2view.com][5], [Wikipedia][2])
  * Keeps hallucinations in check thanks to source citations.

### 3. **MVP & GTM**

* **Hybrid of Prompt-Based + RAG**

  * Why: Templates and structured guidance (prompt logic) complemented by examples, use cases, and data lookup via RAG (e.g., popular go-to-market channels for specific industries, pricing benchmarks).

### 4. **Pitch (including TAM/SAM/SOM narrative and slide skeletons)**

* **Consider Agentic RAG**

  * Why: Crafting pitch decks involves reasoning, multi-step construction: market sizing, narrative flow, structured outputs. Agentic RAG systems are built for that kind of multi-step decision-making and tool orchestration. They can plan, retrieve, construct, and adapt.([Medium][3], [arXiv][4])

## Architectural Summary

| Stage      | Best Approach       | Why It Works Well                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ideation   | Prompt-based Chat   | Simple structure, fast, no live data needed             |
| Validation | RAG-enhanced Chat   | Needs accurate, sourced market and competitor data      |
| MVP & GTM  | Prompt + RAG Hybrid | Structured guidance plus external examples and stats    |
| Pitch      | Agentic RAG         | Multistep reasoning, dynamic retrieval, narrative build |

## Key Trade-Offs & Considerations

* **Complexity vs Simplicity**

  * Prompt-based is quick to build and easy to control.
  * RAG requires vector databases or search infrastructure for knowledge sources.
  * Agentic RAG adds orchestration, planning modules—powerful, but highest complexity and compute.

* **Accuracy & Freshness**

  * Agentic RAG and RAG drastically reduce hallucinations and enable fresh, relevant examples. Prompt-only systems risk generic or outdated responses.

* **Security & Maintenance**

  * RAG centralizes data and risks outdated sync or access control issues. Some enterprises pivot away from RAG toward agent-based architectures to avoid these pitfalls.([TechRadar][6])

## What I Recommend

* **Phase 1 (MVP):** Build prompt-driven flows for **Ideation and Validation**, with a simple RAG layer for market data in Validation.
* **Phase 2 (Growth):** Transition to **Agentic RAG** for **Pitch stage**, enabling narrative construction, TAM/SAM/SOM estimation, and slide outputs via multi-step autonomous agents.
* **Monitor & Iterate**: Start simple. Once you validate core user flows, add RAG capabilities selectively where fresh data improves guidance.

### TL;DR

* **Ideation** → Prompt-driven chat
* **Validation** → RAG-enhanced prompts
* **MVP / GTM** → Hybrid prompts + RAG
* **Pitch** → Agentic RAG for multi-step tool orchestration
